This repository contains integration examples for several different languages and platforms. Check the code folder for the language or platform used by your company.

Also check out the JangoMail Web Service Tutorial at http://www.jangomail.com/documents/Public/JangoMail_Tutorial_API.pdf

And the full JangoMail API specification is here: http://api.jangomail.com/

Don't forget that you don't necessarily need to use the API to integrate with JangoMail or JangoSMTP. Some features are accessible via email.
